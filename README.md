In this project, I investigate whether doctors might be able to group together patients to target treatments using common unsupervised learning techniques.

I use k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms. 

The data we are analyzing comes from the V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, CA and contains characteristics of patients diagnosed with heart disease.
